      "taskTitle": "Implement RabbitMQ Connection and Listener",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement RabbitMQ Connection and Listener' task into 4 subtasks focusing on connection management, message routing, error handling, and health monitoring. For each subtask, specify implementation details, edge cases to handle, and testing requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the need for robust connection handling, retry logic, and graceful shutdown. Implementing proper message routing and error recovery for RabbitMQ requires careful design and error handling."
